# ToDo-App Project

A user-friendly ToDo-App built with HTML, React, and TypeScript. The app allows users to easily manage their tasks by adding and deleting todos, marking them as completed, and syncing with an external API to fetch and send todos.

The app includes several features to improve the user experience, such as the ability to select and deselect all todos at once, sort by active and completed tasks, delete all completed todos, and edit specific todos by double-clicking on the content.
